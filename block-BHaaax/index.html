        <h2>Mountains</h2>
        <p>
          A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with
          steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. A mountain differs
          from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a
          hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the
          surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur
          in mountain ranges.[1] Mountains are formed through tectonic forces,
          erosion, or volcanism,[1] which act on time scales of up to tens of
          millions of years.[2] Once mountain building ceases, mountains are
          slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and
          other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and
          glaciers. High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at
          sea level at similar latitude. These colder climates strongly affect
          the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different
          plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and
          climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for
          resource extraction, such as mining and logging, along with
          recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing. The highest mountain
          on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is
          8,850 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level. The highest known mountain
          on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m
          (69,459 ft).
