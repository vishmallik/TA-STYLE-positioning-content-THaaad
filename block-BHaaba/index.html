            A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally
            with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. A mountain
            differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is
            larger than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet)
            above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits,
            but most occur in mountain ranges.[1] Mountains are formed through
            tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism,[1] which act on time scales
            of up to tens of millions of years.[2] Once mountain building
            ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of
            weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as
            well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers. High elevations on
            mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar
            latitude.
